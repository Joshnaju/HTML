        <div>
            <p>
            The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system. None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.

        <div>
         
        <p>
         The design for the Olympic medals for the 2020 Summer Olympics was created by Junichi Kawanishi. The medals were manufactured using metal extracted from recycled small electronic devices donated by the public. The ribbon uses the traditional Japanese design motifs found in ichimatsu moyo, a harmonised chequered pattern, and kasane no irome, a traditional kimono layering technique, in a modern presentation. The case is manufactured from Japanese ash wood dyed with the same colour as the Olympic emblem. The circular lid and the body of the case can be opened like a ring connected by a magnet. The obverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, in front of Panathenaic Stadium and the Olympic rings.
        </p>
        <p>

        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, athletes were presented with their medals on trays, and were asked to put them on themselves (or each other, in case of team winners), rather than having them placed around their necks by a dignitary.
